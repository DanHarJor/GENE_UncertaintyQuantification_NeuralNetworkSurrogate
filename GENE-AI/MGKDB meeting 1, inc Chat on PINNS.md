Yann & Jonathan citrin both helped integrate with IMAS, for gene Done.

Some quantities of interest are not in IMAS

Through VTT I can get an IMAS agreement forum to allow me to download IMAS and play with it.

New guy working on MGKDB, he has started and is getting the grips of things.



Jax is like numpy but more restrictive and 10 times faster.

PINNS
not usefull without data
for complex geometry can be much better than traditional methods. 

An interesting strategie is to use traditional methods with a coarse grid and then use the data from the coarse grid traditional methods with PINNS to get higher fidelity results. 

Don't try to replace traditional methods but augment them. Development gains

It is possible to train a neural network to get a solution operator, whatever that means. Ulises 

Bayesian NN for prob dist, great but difficult to train

It is normal to get a non physical solution with a PINN, it is an approximation at the end of the day

Numerical issues is that it is discrete, although there are meshless methods being developed

The are GPR methods for solving ODE and PDE
