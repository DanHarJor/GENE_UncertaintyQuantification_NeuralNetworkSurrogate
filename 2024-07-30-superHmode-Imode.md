Today I read about super H mode. EPED predicts three crossing points between the pedestal height limit for KBM and PB-MHD limits when the tokamak is in some extream triangularity scenarios. The first one is h-mode and the higher ones are called super h-mode. They can be accssed with a density arc transition.

I also read about I-mode (Improved-mode). This has an H-mode temperature profile and an L-mode density profile. This is great because the energy is confined and so there is a large energy confinement time needed for fusion performance but the particles are not well confined meaning there is a large particle flux on the divertor but impurities become less of an issue as they follow the stream of particles to the divertor. This reduces core radiation losses and improves fusion performance.

I imagine the pressure profile to something between an L-mode and an H-mode meaning there might not be any MHD-instabilites or ELMS and so we rely on the transport limitations to give us accurate profile trajectories.
