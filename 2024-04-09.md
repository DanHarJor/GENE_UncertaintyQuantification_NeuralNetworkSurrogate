Today I started gathering concepts and notes for the DEEPlasma meeting on thursday where I will introduce GENE, gyrokinetics, microturbulance, and the linear simulation we are trying to simulate. 

I talked to adam about different models we can impliment. 

I read about Bayesian neural networks and stochastic neural networks. Apparently they are tricky to train, data hungry and computationally expensive as you need to compute the marginal likelihood with integration.
