Meeting Summary:


New post doc is being hired through ODEN
He used to work with GENE at IPP. 
Todd is the principle investigator for the new postdoc. Todd is doing bayesian models and UQ for the pedestal project. 

David said, early september we should have a 6h workshop where we go over what has been done and what we want from everyone.

For fingerprints, only linear gene is enough, when quasi-linear was mentioned in the paper it must have been a typo. 

For the idea of KBM threshold when I asked about how I should vary density and temperature gradient to find the KBM limit David started talking about the equilibrium and that is should be reconstructed as the profile changes. Joseph is working on getting CHEESE linked to GENE, perhaps I could get HELENA linked up.

For the input deck, I need to scan alpha_MHD and collisionality. Alpha_MHD is dependant on other parameters and needs to be computed. I should check I have the other dependencies worked out properly too.

David mentioned he usually makes surrogate models for a specific pedestal for a specific shot. Perhaps he could share how he scanned the parameter space to ensure the dependencies are correct for that, perhaps I could try the same one. He offered to share data with me.
