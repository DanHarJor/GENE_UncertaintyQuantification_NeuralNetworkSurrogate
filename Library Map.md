This file is intended to give an overview of what is in the library, why it is there and some notes on each item after I have read it.

# GENE SURROGATE
[[CitrinGENEnnSurrogate.pdf]]
J Citrin was in a TSVV1 meeting and I googled him to find he had published a paper on making a GENE surrogate with neural networks.

section 3.2 Physics-informed Active Learning for gyro-kinetic models with ADEPT

# Instabilities
Aaro wants me to produce a line for max pressure of kinetic ballooining modes from gyrokinetics and amanda to produce a line for peeling-ballooning modes from MHD mishka to determine the maximum pressure you can have before getting either of these modes. He mentioned this on my first day and referenced figure 33 of this paper
