This file is intended to give an overview of what is in the library, why it is there and some notes on each item after I have read it.

# Stuff to Look For
People to Look for material from
gyrokinetics textbooks, papers
Brizard Cary
Littlejohn

Finish guy Aalto does gyrokinetics
Hirvijoki

# GENE SURROGATE
[[CitrinGENEnnSurrogate.pdf]]
J Citrin was in a TSVV1 meeting and I googled him to find he had published a paper on making a GENE surrogate with neural networks.

# Physics Informed Machine Learning with Active Learning for Gyrokinetics
[[Zanisi_physInfALforGyrokinetics.pdf]]
section 3.2 Physics-informed Active Learning for gyro-kinetic models with ADEPT

# Joost PhD with Michael Abdelmalik
bottom upâ€™, in the sense that we are working on a machine learning methodology for fast solution of PDEs in general.

# Gyrokinetics
Jenko wrote a chapter on gyrokinetics in this book
[[FrankJenkoGyrokineticIntroduction.pdf|space and astrophysical plasma simulation]]


# Instabilities
Aaro wants me to produce a line for max pressure of kinetic ballooining modes from gyrokinetics and amanda to produce a line for peeling-ballooning modes from MHD mishka to determine the maximum pressure you can have before getting either of these modes. He mentioned this on my first day and referenced figure 33 of this paper
