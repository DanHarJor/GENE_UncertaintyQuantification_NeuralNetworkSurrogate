I learned that many of these codes produce unrealistic results, including SOLPS and GENE. 
I thought ML could help improve these code by only training on the physically realistic results and interpolating to where the original model was wrong. 

I thought you could make a ML model to identify when the output is physically realistic to help with large dataset cleaning.
