Q>5 is good for reactor scale, enough fusion energy to get reasonable electricity yield

frzen pellets fulling, spin in centrifudge and thrown into plasma. Pellet injection??

NBI not used for reactor scale, why not?

the tokamak will be a pulsed machine, best case 12h on and 1h off. Use molten salts to store heat for 1 h off. This is due to engineering issues with the current drive

Plane crash into Fusion reactor would result in HTO or T2O cloud that is radioactive. 

What is a Plasma
If there are too many collisions then the ionised gas can behave like a normal gas and have no usual plasma properties such as

magnetically confineable
deby shielding
landau dampening, wave particle interaction of em radiation making it opaque.
