Today I read Aaro's suggestions for the poster, chatted with him about the flow chart. I need to talk to Amanda about it to add the MHD check.

I then proceded to update the GENE_ML to include a gpr walltime estimator and a way to continue the scan if it isn't finished. Still needs some further implementation and testing.
