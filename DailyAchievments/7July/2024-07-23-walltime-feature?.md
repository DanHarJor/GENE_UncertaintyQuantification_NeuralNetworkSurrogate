today plan is to finish the walltime feature and start running some more data for both DEEPlasma and UQ


WHile working on the walltime feature It was decided that the deeplasma runs are taking too long and I should spend my time getting the poster ready. 

The deeplasma runs are taking so long that we should try and make a mechanisim to increase the timelim gradually to see what data we can get with less time and then investigate the runs that take long while mesuring the lower bound for how long they take.
