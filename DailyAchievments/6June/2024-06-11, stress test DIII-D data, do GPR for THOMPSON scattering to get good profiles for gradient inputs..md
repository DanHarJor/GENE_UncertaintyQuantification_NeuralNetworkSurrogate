today I almost finished the trip to the US organisation

We had a meeting with adam and amanda since Aaro couldn't make wednesday and it was Adams last day.

Adam mentioned that DIII-D is making a nice way to grab data effeciently and effectivly for large workflows and need stress testing. Could be good when I do my scale mode identification. 

We Identified a problem with Amandas helena/mishka implimentation was that she is not shifting to profile to account for seperatrix position error. Adams profile fitting technique is creating artifacts that cause helena/mishka to crash. I suggested GPR and landed myself the job to do what I did in ma masters for this. Basicly a reimplimentation of chilenski's work.
