No GENE due to PEPc and SLEPc permission issues. When I tried to copy it I lost permission so quickly. I then tried again and magically I had permission but I his a number of files limit for the project. It seems the /users/gorlerto/soft folder has a lot of files. The limit is 100,000. 

I attended the finnfusion meeting and had a good chat with Aaro and Laurent about the project. We decided the KMB gradient limiting could be a good way to connect the surrogate to experiment for a proof of principle paper with Amanda. 

I experimented with LUMI-O it looks like the LUMI version of ALLAS

Wished id got around to:
Get UQ- 1D Plots showing non smoothness
Read Papers if have time
