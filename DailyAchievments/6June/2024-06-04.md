Today I tried to link the polynomial fitting to gene. I lost access to petc ans slepc which stopped gene from being able to run and halted progress. 

todo:
check that when I run gene and collect data they are in the same order as the sampler makes the points. This is essential for the ssg_poly model to be able to train.
