Before this I read davids paper on mode identification : https://doi.org/10.1088/0029-5515/56/10/104003

Today there was the DEEPlasma meeting with David Hatch, Cole, and Aaro. We went over the current status of the surrogate which is some GPR, XGBoost and SVM very simply implemented. 

I need to look into doing a fixed grid ky. As there is some sum of ky's. [[Q-Answers#Grid ky or Random ky]]

I need to fix nans. Probably they aren't being ran for long enough. 

talked about getting saturation rule with non-linear and experimentation, validation with profiles as Adam explained

We would need to do some linear mode identification anyway. Lets do some large scale mode identification.
