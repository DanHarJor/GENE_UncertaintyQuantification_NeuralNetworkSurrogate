After easter holidays

Today I have continued running gene for UQ. The previous runs ended early and so I am continuing them so I can get a large number of gardients for a single ky. UQscan2

I looked at davids parameters file and tried to run it. I got multiprocessing errors so I am going to take the working UQscan2 and alter it slowly to include davids parameter file. I decided to finish this another day.

I am now trying to generate a gene parameters file containing static grid points, using f90nml package
