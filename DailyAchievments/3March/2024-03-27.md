Today I had the team meeting with Adam, Amanda and Aaro

we hashed some stuff out about enchanted surrogates. 

I made VS code connect to a singularity container. I need to install nbcondakernels onto the container so I can use notebooks to visualise plots. 

When I tried to make a new enviroment it solved for at least 30min. SO I need to remove some packages.
