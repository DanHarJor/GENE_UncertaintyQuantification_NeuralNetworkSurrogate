Today I will get the notebooks working on the container, get my growthrate as a function of ky plot.

Use Ionut's notebook to get the static SG points. 

Generate the same number of random points.
twice as many random points
tree times as many random points.

train xgboost or sklearn function as an interpolator

plot the growthrate distributions as histograms. 

I got to plot gamma vs ky but there wasn't enough points each ky to get a good UQ. SO I did a different run with less ky and more grad T points. 

see how it goes.
