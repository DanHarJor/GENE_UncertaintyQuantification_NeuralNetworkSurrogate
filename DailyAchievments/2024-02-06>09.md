On these days I was in tarvaniemi workshop. It was great to listen to scrape off layer experts and how they discuss their research. 

ITER is having a rebaseline to save money

whether or not to do berillium conditioning is a big question. The berillium is not a plasma facing component. It only conditions the carbon or tungston, it does not cover it. 

I met Lorenzo, a pedestool expert

I met David from Georgia, he focuses on scrape off layer physics and he works in Prague. 

# crazy idea
I learned that many of these codes produce unrealistic results, including SOLPS and GENE. 
I thought ML could help improve these code by only training on the physically realistic results and interpolating to where the original model was wrong. 

I thought you could make a ML model to identify when the output is physically realistic to help with large dataset cleaning.
