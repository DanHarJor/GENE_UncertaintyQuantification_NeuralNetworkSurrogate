Today I worked to make the interface of gene-ml allow results to be saved so that to alter the plots in the future the training does not need to be completed. 

I had the wednesday meeting with the team and the poster was discussed along with the active learning progress with enchanted surrogates. I need to work to get dask and containers to work on lumi so we can manage our packages smoothly.
