Today I tested the ssh to the new japanese csc cluster. 

I invesitgated how to distinguish between a nan that is an unconverged stable mode and one that is unconverged for another reason. I believe that converged and stable dominant modes will be returned as negative grothrate but is simply really rare for the parameter space I am searching. I asked tobias about this.

I also investigated gyrokinetic code validation techniques and discovered some great papers that could help make a quasi-linear gene model and validate it.
