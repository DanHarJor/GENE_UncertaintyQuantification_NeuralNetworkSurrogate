GENE-ML should be working and needs some final testing for the collection of data from many scan files into one dataframe. 

After the tests a large run should be made which explores more parameters of interest. 

A large run was carried out with 7 parameters and GPR was shown to largely overfit to the training data and perform poorly on the test data.
