Today I will prepare some questions that have been bothering me.

I will finish linking the gene scan parser with the sg, DONE

I looked at the result of the 100points for DEEPlasma, 50% of the growthrates are NaN's. Apparently this means either the initial value solver didn't converge on one mode or that it is stable. I changed to eigan value solver to see if this helps get less nans. 

I will change the UQ visualisation note book that does SVM so that when generating the histograms it samples from a gaussian with a mean being the nominal values and the bounds the 95% confidance interval. I will show the nominal growth rate and 95% confidence bounds on the histogram with vertical lines.
