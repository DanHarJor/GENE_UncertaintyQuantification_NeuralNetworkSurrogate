today we had the first pedestal physics coffee session. It wen't really well. It will be difficult for Marcine to keep up. 

Then I communicated on slack about the potential for determine a non physical region of the parameter space where we have went far beyond the KBM threshold, have high eta (temp and dens gradients are out of wack), numerical instabilities are blocking the real instability in the IV solver.
