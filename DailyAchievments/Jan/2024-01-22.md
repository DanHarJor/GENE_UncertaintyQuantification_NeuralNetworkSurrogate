gyrokinetics 

Laurent Chôné
The L-H mode transition, involves a higher flow at the edge which destroyes the turbulent flows. This reduces the transport to the plasma facing components. That is why it is known as the transport barrier. 

Qualikitz does not keep track of the individual particles. It looks at magnetic field, plasma profiles, machine parameters.

# Day plan
today I will bullet point what I want to write in my research paper.

make my intro slide for fridays meeting,

try and compile gene on LUMI, nope

submit my M2 for travel plan, need bank details
