I tried to write a scan parameters file from the parameters_miller file from david for DEEPlasma. I ran into some problems. if shat=0 gene throws an error. Colle told me that. The omn (particle density gradient) must be the same for ion and electron to ensure quasineutrality. At the moment there are just two species so the densities should be the same. But when there are more species perhaps this is not the case. 

for quasi neutrality perhaps the densities must also follow some rules.
