Tuesday, 2h of meetings

I will 
Finish the reading list first draft
In the library folder I have placed papers within the research proposal and from the offocial GENE webpage and a few from gooling people in the meetings on zoom. But there were issues with medley and I am not sure this is the best way for us to share papers as a team. Maybe just a one drive.

Meeting about eurofusion ML/AI call
MJ Pueschel from TU/e raised concerns that there are two similar projects. One that is aiming on making a database of gyrokinetics and advancing the ML side of database creation and another that is planning on accelerating GENE with machine learning / surrogate modeling parts of that. 

Meeting about TSVV1
During the meeting I googled the participants and I came across Jonathan Cirtin. Who has already done something similar.
