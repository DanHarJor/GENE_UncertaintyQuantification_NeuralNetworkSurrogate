Wednesday

I did an 1h onboarding meeting

I read part of Ionut UQ thesis

I had an ACH TVVS-01-UQ meeting.
Tobias Will get input parameters for sharp mode jump which is where the UQ struggles and we can improve it. 
I need to compile GENE and get some basic runs
He mentioned it will be made to use IMAS format at the moment it used GKDB
He said when it goes to IMAS it will be easy to compare GENE and GKW, another gyrokinetic code.

Ionut will send me materials. He also mentioned
I will do Full read Parameter which is impractcal but he found a way to sample the input more cleverly. I think this has something to do with choosing the input parameters that are at the peak in the posterior of the uncertainties. SO start with the stupid way and do it cleverly later. Ionut will show me. 

He said his UQ code is in python 2 and there might be compatability issues. 
His code just needs the input and output of GENE

Next steps are for me to compile GENE on LUMI and do some basic runs.
