What is the physics that needs to be solved and its current speeds, can be joined to initial paragraph as says same thing with more words. 

The standard operational scenarios projected to provide reactor-relevant performance require a self-organized transport barrier and formation of a pressure pedestal at the edge. One of the most demanding components of core-edge integration predictions is related to simulations of the residual plasma turbulence that regulates heat and particle transport within this transport barrier [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and refences therein]. These transport fluxes can be simulated by solving a nonlinear, saturated turbulent state of the gyrokinetic (GK) Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations, which is the most advanced theory for turbulence in strongly magnetized plasmas. GK applies the scale-separation between the fast gyro-motion of charged particles in the magnetic field, ∼ 10−9 − 10−7 s, and the slow turbulence evolution, 10−5 s, to reduce the fully kinetic Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations by averaging through the fast dynamics. Despite this reduction, a single nonlinear GK calculations takes of the order of 104 – 106 CPU hours. Clearly such computational demands are 2(15) incompatible with the needs of power plant design or real-time control applications, which require thousands of these flux calculations for macroscopic time-evolution, ∼ 1 s, of the plasma scenario. Due to this computational challenge, core-edge integration predictions in reactor design activities typically apply reduced models that bypass the need to solve the GK equations. An example of such approach is the ballooning critical pedestal technique in the EPED model [12]. However, such model reductions propagate the resulting prediction uncertainty as a significant investment risk in the large and expensive reactor-scale facilities.  

Not enough data problem and solution 

Fast surrogate models have been developed for core plasma transport reduced turbulence models, such as QLKNN and TGLFNN [27, 28, 29]. Although this has not been performed for pedestal turbulent transport before. This is presumably due to the complexity of pedestal plasmas requiring more complete GK treatment, including electromagnetic effects, leading to increased computational requirements in creating the training database for surrogate model development. 

more details on how Bayesian methods can be used to generate high information gain data 

The established surrogate model is an approximation of the ground truth full model and uncertainty quantification is, therefore, essential to gauge the quality of the surrogate model predictions. We aim to use Bayesian machine learning methods for neural networks and Gaussian processes [45, 46] to model the uncertainties caused by the model uncertainty (T3.1). When applied to surrogate model training on the dataset, they can provide uncertainty bounds on the PEGENENN predictions (T3.2). For computations, we aim to initially use the variational Bayesian methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods already available in TensorFlow probability [47], but we will significantly need to extend them for the physics-informed models. Figure 4 shows an example of a simple Gaussian process-based probabilistic solution to the (viscous) Burger’s equation using a yet-unpublished PDE-extension of the method from [43]. Figure 4: Gaussian process (GP)-based probabilistic solution to Burger’s equation. The Gaussian process-based solver also provides the uncertainty (confidence interval) for the solution. As the model becomes aware about the inference uncertainty, such an uncertainty can be applied in an acquisition function to recommend new evaluations of the computationally costly full model that would lead to optimal reduction of the prediction uncertainty (T3.3). In this project this active learning task is done using Bayesian optimization methods [48] which are methods that can do active learning while properly taking the uncertainties into account. Once appropriate probabilistic methods and acquisition functions are established, these will be used to enhance the training dataset to optimize the accuracy of the surrogate model with the given computational resources (T3.4). 

the potential of physics informed ML 

Physics informed machine learning is a new discipline being developed although it has already had success in a diverse set of problems. [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Physics based loss functions and regularisation terms can be designed to penalise the model when it deviates from known physical laws. This can allow the trained model to extrapolate beyond its training domain and be trained on more scarcely separated data. This can reduce the need to obtain a large amount of high fidelity training data from GENE.  

Mention this is the long term goal and what are the first steps that could be published in a paper seperatly.   

Overall goals 

The specific objectives of the project are: • O1: Demonstrate that the modern HPC environments, such as LUMI, provide the necessary computational power to enable machine learning acceleration of the highly demanding pedestal GK simulations. • O2: Develop suitable physics-informed constraints for pedestal GK to limit the need to oversample the training domain with the full computationally costly physics model. • O3: Demonstrate that by applying the physics-informed approach as well as Bayesian methods to populate the training domain with optimal information gain for each full simulation, order of magnitude reduction in the necessary density of training data is achieved. • O4: Building on top of the success in achieving the above objectives, leverage the leadingedge computational capabilities of LUMI to generate a production level PEGENENN 

creating the data base start with linear because it is faster  

One of the leading challenges in generating surrogate models for GK plasma turbulence simulations is related to the computational cost of generating a sufficiently large training database for the model. A fully nonlinear GK simulation for a single radial location can be as expensive as 104 – 106 CPU hours. Clearly generating a high-density training database for a multidimensional domain with these computational costs would be an enormous computational task. 

Furthermore, nonlinear simulations can be susceptible to convergence challenges and numerical difficulties rendering large batch execution of cases very challenging. Linear GK, on the other hand, provides a stable predictor of stability thresholds, turbulence drives, growth rates, mode frequencies, and eigenfunctions with a reasonable computational cost of the order of 103 CPU hours. With the recent progress towards GPU execution, this is expected to be even faster. With these computational costs, it is feasible to generate a proof-of-principle training database of local, linear GK simulations for pedestal parameters with the computational time available through LUMI Regular Access mode (details are given later in this section) 

Goals for physics informed ML 

To first establish the regression baseline, traditional machine learning models are trained with the proof-of-principle database established in WP1 (T2.1). These are expected to provide the worstcase performance when only mean square error or similar regression performance metric is applied without any actual physics-informed constraints. These traditional machine learning models will be implemented in TensorFlow and Keras [33, 34] as simple deep learning neural networks [35] with a relatively low number of convolutional and dense layers with ReLU activations, and trained with standard methods such as SGD or Adam.  

Once the regression performance baseline is established, physics-informed constraints will be investigated. 

Finding appropriate physics-laws to constrain machine learning regression models for linear GK stability calculations can be quite challenging. Therefore, this is identified as a separate task in the work (T2.2). Physics-informed constraints can probably be constructed based on dispersion relations, along the lines discussed by Hatch et al. [32] and Parisi et al. [36]. Furthermore, physically plausible combinations of turbulence drives, growth rates, mode frequencies, and eigenfunctions can be deduced from the characteristics of the various modes and these can be provided as constraints to the machine learning model 

Big Picture for Full Plasma Simulations 

DEEPlasma aims to address this challenge by combining the leading-edge computational capabilities of LUMI with physics-informed and Bayesian approaches to reduce the necessary density of training data for accurate surrogate model development. The physics-informed constraints will improve the extrapolation and interpolation performance of the model and the Bayesian methods aim to selectively simulate the training cases that are expected to yield optimal information gain in terms of surrogate model accuracy. PEGENENN would provide fast local, linear stability predictions, which when coupled with appropriate mapping from the linear stability to transport would yield a very fast, GK-based transport model for pedestal plasmas. This mapping from linear GK to transport is the focus of complementary research of our international partners in US. When coupling the two components, (1) PEGENENN from DEEPlasma with (2) the linear to transport mapping from the research in US, the resulting GK-based pedestal transport model can yield a new paradigm in core-edge integrated scenario simulations. Eventually, when coupled with fast models for global pedestal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability and scrape-off layer (SOL) transport, which are being addressed through other research activities within EUROfusion, a fast, high-fidelity, physics-based model for the entire edge from the pedestal top to the reactor wall will become possible. Such a model would represent a scientific breakthrough for power exhaust and core edge integration predictions in these fusion devices. 

Previous attempt 

The GENE code can be used to compute gyroradius-scale fluctuations and transport coefficients in magnetized plasmas. It solves the nonlinear gyrokinetic equations on a fixed volume grid in five dimensional phase space. The intent of the research is to develop a neural network that can be trained using GENE outputs as labels. The training will be directed using regularization methods inspired by physical laws. The development will begin with the construction of a database of training data outputted by GENE ran on high performance computing systems. GENE is computationally demanding and data scarcity is expected despite the large resources available. To overcome this Bayesian methods will be used to identify GENE input parameters that will output labels with a high information yield.  

GENE is an open source plasma microturbulence code which can be used to efficiently compute gyroradius-scale fluctuations and the resulting transport coefficients in magnetized fusion/astrophysical plasmas. To this aim, it solves the nonlinear gyrokinetic equations on a fixed grid in five-dimensional phase space (plus time).
