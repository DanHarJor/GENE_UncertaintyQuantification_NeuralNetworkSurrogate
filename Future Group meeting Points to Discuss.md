I found Joost
pipeline for running gene at large scale. see if he has code for it. 

It is now a task to understand what has been or is being done and how I can add to this. Perhaps I should do this before applying for a PhD...? or maybe I can apply with what we have and then change it after. 

Is the abstract submitted??
Maybe this should mean that I don't submit the abstract for the conference. As it will take more time to identify the best path for the research and what we will do cannot be determined right now.

I also don't think another DEEPlasma meeting would be beneficial until all other research into the area has been identified and a research plan to contribute has been made.

Also MJ Pueschel has suggested monthly of bymonthly meeting with other people working in the area. We could expand out DEEPlasma group under a new name to include these other people working in the Area.


Who was in the Eurofusion Funding Group meeting, why only these people allowed to contribute to your grand master plan. Is there a slack for these people??
