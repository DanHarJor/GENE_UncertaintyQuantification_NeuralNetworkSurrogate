If we rigorously quantify the model uncertainty based on lack of data, using Bayesian statistics, like GPR then we do not need to use test data. This reduces the need for making data, makes it viable for high cost UQ and can be directly used for active learning. 

Could we do this using bayes theorum and model inferences??
