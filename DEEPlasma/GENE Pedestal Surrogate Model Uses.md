Astra models the whole tokamak plasma by integrating micro turbulence and transport models. No one expects tglf to be accurate for the pedestal. Aaro and David think that a quasilinear gene surrogate could be accurate in the surrogate.

# Replacing Kinetic Ballooning mode limit for pedestal gradient

Apparently this instability limits the gradient at the pedestal. Models of this macro-instability are used to determine the gradient of the pedestal. Gene could be used to get the gradient limit imposed by micro-turbulence within the pedestal.
