# Latin Hypercube Sampling

# Strength 2 sobol sequence, (George Holt, UK)

This is a quasi monte carlo method. Iouts thinks it is better at getting a low discrepancy from uniform that latin hyper cube. 

# Quasi-Montecarlo for sampling in high dimensions
low discrepancy from uniform, fill whole space.
