Is KBM a macro or micro-instability?

"(1) onset of non-local peeling-ballooning modes at low to intermediate mode number, (2) onset of nearly local kinetic ballooning modes at high mode number." Snyder

"The KBM is a short wavelength, pressure gradient driven instability. It can be considered as the kinetic analog of the local MHD ballooning mode, and has a similar threshold for instability in the limit of zero ion temperature gradient, and a slightly lower threshold with finite ion temperature gradient.23–25"

"The KBM has been studied extensively with electromagnetic gyrofluid and gyrokinetic codes in simple geometry, finding an onset near the ideal ballooning threshold in pressure gradient and growth rates and fluxes that increase strongly beyond this threshold.25–29"

Does KBM cause pedestal crash, or ELMS?

How does david identify KBM if the fingerprints model only clasifies MHD-like modes. 
# When local breaks down for KBM
There are also some of these that are un-physically broad radially, which means the local approximation is not well-suited to assessing their stability.  You can keep an eye out for these by comparing eigenmode averaged <kx> vs the pedestal width (something like 2pi/Lp).
