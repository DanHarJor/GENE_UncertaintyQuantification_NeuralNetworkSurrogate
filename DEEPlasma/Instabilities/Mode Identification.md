Also MTM can be identified by a symmertric ballooning plot as said in the William Hornsby paper we sent ([https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0174478](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0174478 "https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0174478")).

Then ETG only appears in high ky. And currently we are only scanning low ky so we don't need to worry about that.

ITG and TEM is almost completly suppressed by the flow shear in the pedestal and so we don't expect to see these.

So mainly we want to know if we have one of MHD-like or MTM.

The resulting Doppler shift is Ω = nEr RBθ . The maximum (over radial location) Doppler shifted frequency is a useful discriminator between ion frequency fluctuations, like kinetic ballooning modes (KBMs), and fluctuations with frequencies strongly in the electron direction like MTMs.

# Baloon plots

There are distinct transitions in the baloon plots when moving between regions of smoothness,

on the 4th red dot we transition from this

to this

Without even knowing what modes these plots refer to we can use them to identify regions of smoothnes with clustering. Potentially an autoencoder to go into feature space, where the clustering might perform better. 

# MTM vs ETG
These both have similar fingerprints but can be differentiated with EM vs ES flux

0 to ~0.3 is MTM and the rest is ETG
