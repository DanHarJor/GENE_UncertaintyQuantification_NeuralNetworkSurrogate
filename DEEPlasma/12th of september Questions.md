Is this the amplitude of fluctuations in a linear simulation? 
Can gene provide the gradients as a function of time for as the distribution evolves?

Is it okay if I group MTM and ETG into one category as it might be hard to seperate them reliably.

ETG is not relevant as I am doing low ky scans. Usually MTM occurs in small regions of ky.

Do you think this effectively covers parameter dependencies? T, 0.1 to 1keV, others check tokamak.

Are the ranges for the reference values okay?
\
lw is the upper end of the simulation box in the mu direction, should I change it as its units change to keep it constant?


How did Joseph generate the plots for identifying numerical instabilities by eye. I will do this for a subset of data points. 

Resolution Increases, 
Greater Number of grid points in x,z,vpara,mu
Number of fourrier modes, nky0 = 1
Time Step -> smaller
