# interpretive vs predictive transport 

"A key contribution of these codes is that they quantify the various sources (e.g. heating by energetic neutral beams, fuelling by recycling neutrals) and sinks (e.g. radiative energy losses) of density, momentum and energy in the plasma. This information allows one to determine via ‘interpretive’ transport analysis the plasma transport required to obtain the experimentally measured density and temperature profiles. Conversely, in ‘predictive’ transport analysis one uses theoretically predicted plasma transport properties to predict the profiles."

I think interpretive transport reffers to getting the diffusivity and fluxes along the profile that must be present given the sources and experimentally measured profile.

I think that we are planning on doing predictive transport analysis.
