"The linear system exhibits multiple (greater than ten) unstable eigenmodes at each perpendicular wave vector, representing different toroidal and slab branches of the ETG instability."

"With this decomposition, one can see how many nonlinear modes need to be considered at each ky to account for the heat flux."

"One might expect the high number of active modes to complicate quasilinear approaches to reduced modeling for this scenario. However, Hatch et al.8 demonstrate that an accurate reduced model can in fact be constructed from the most unstable eigenmode alone (albeit with an additional parameter dependence on g Â¼ Ln=LT )."

"Despite the fact that intrinsically nonlinear structures dominate the fluctuations at most scales, the persistence of linear physics in a **single narrow region of k-space** is consistent with the efficacy of a generalized quasilinear model, which uses the linear eigenmode at a single wavenumber to predict nonlinear heat flux."
Should I be worried about this single narrow region of K-space?
