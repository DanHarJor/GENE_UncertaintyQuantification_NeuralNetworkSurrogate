1. Sometimes you beat around the bush and dodge a question. Its a classic tactic to avoid confrontation. For example when I suggested about making slides for the first physics coffee meeting you avoided encouraging the slides and also didn't say you don't think the slides are necessary. SO I am left guessing. I am learning to understand in finland when someone is deploying this tactic and then I know that they disaggree with me but it isn't necessary. Sometimes it is simpler to be direct. I don't think the sides are necessary Daniel, but if you think they are important I won't oppose it. Is an example of what you could have said. Stating your oppinion directly and politely without me having to guess if you disagree or not. If you don't tell me you disagree I can never be sure. For more important things you have just said your oppinion so I guess it doesn't matter too much. 
   
 2. You are super well read and have a lot of knowledge. This sometimes leads to very difficult conversations full of jargon. It is great because I get used to the language used in the papers and can read/write them easier. But it is sometimes bad if it is my first introduction to the topic and I can't follow what you are saying. This is especially important to manage when giving a talk/presentation or teaching a class. It is super important to be aware of the level of the audience and cater the language to meet them. For example in the very first DEEPlasma kickoff meeting, there was a lot of jargon and I barely followed a little so I doubt Simo and Ulisses would have been able to follow. In the FinnFusion meetings, I think many have never seen bayesian inference and amortised inference and struggle with a lot of the vocab sting along in sequence. I appreciate you have been super busy and it can take time to explain things properly. But some small attention to trying to keep your audience with you in mind could be a good think to keep in mind.
