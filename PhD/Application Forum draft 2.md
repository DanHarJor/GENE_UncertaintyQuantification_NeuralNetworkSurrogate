Fundamental Direct Band Gap of Antimony Selenide (Sb$_2$Se$_3$) and Implications for Potential use in Photovoltaics

grade 67/100

In 2017 Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) was an promising light absorber for use in photovoltaic solar pannels. It is composed of cheap, Earth-abundant, non-toxic elements, has benign grain boundaries (reducing recombination losses) and is easy to deposit onto a substrate. Spectrophotometry was used on samples grown via close space sublimation, to measure the absorption spectra and infer the fundamental direct band gap. Which is a very important value to know when trying to absorb a specific wavelength of light from the sun. My thesis reported the fundamental direct band gap to be 1.19 Â± 0.04 eV at room temperature. The Shockley Quiesser limit shows antimony selenide has a theoretical maximum efficiency of 32% if used in solar cells.
