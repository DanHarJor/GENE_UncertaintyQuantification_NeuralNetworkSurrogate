It is mentioned in the readme that the framework is for database generation, I thought the focus was active learning.

It then mentions that downstream training will not be handled. If we do active learning, then we will be training as we go. This required to decide the next points. This means at the end we will have a surrogate trained on all the generated data. So the downstream training will already have been done...

I suppose the focus right now is on database generation for standard ML and active learning will come later. 

# linting
The linting didn't pick up on the cases of def's and classes so it might still be worth mentioning in readme.
