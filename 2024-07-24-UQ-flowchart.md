Today I worked on the new UQ which included a new dimension, density gradient and a higher precision omega_prec=1e-6 and the longer timelim which ment there are no nan's. 

The results of the new precision were very nice. The lack of precision was causing large discontinuities and without these the GPR and SSG histograms agree very well. 

# Poster flow chart
for the ICDDPS5 poster me and Amanda made a flow chart for pedestal prediction. 

It isn't perfect, Aaro was looking at making a version that works to get the full profile evolution. I don't think this is possible unless we can get the flux from MHD instabilities and calculate the profile change. But we can make a steady state predictor. It is an improvement on EPED as it includes more types of instabilites.
