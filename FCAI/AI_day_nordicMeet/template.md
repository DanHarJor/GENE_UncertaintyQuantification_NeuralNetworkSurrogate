## Keywords: keyword 1, keyword 2, keyword 3, keyword 4.

## Use the same font size in the extended abstract. Length of the Extended Abstract should be no more than 500 words including references. All extended abstracts shall be written in English and contain following parts (for detailed instructions, see next page):

Your abstract should contain the following information, in the given order. Each item below should take only 1-2 sentences in your abstract (unless otherwise noted).

1. Outer context:        A short introduction to the field or context of the research problem addressed. This places the research topic within the larger scientific context. Go for “the shortest introduction possible”.

2. Research problem / question:  A short introduction to the research problem. Explain the problem you are addressing, in as simple words as possible. Make sure you describe it at the right level of detail. Not too general - then you are repeating the above point; not too specific - then you leave out some context that is necessary for some of your readership. “The shortest problem presentation possible” (max 4 sentences).

3. Key Motivation:    Why this work was/is worth doing. Make sure the justification is scientific (not personal! - stick to verifiable facts, in the context of scientific progress).

4. Prior attempts at addressing it:      How has this issue been addressed before?

5. Why are prior attempts not enough? How do prior attempts fail at addressing the issue?

6. Method   How did you perform this work? (max 4 sentences at most).

7. Results      What were your results? (max 4 sentences).

(8. Conclusion) Sometimes done to emphasize the main message or conclusion of the work described in the paper.

## Reference Style 

For example:

Files must be in pdf and should be formatted for direct printing. Figures and tables should be embedded and not supplied separately. 

Please make sure that you use as much as possible normal fonts in your documents. Special fonts may cause problems during processing. To avoid unnecessary errors, you are strongly advised to use the ‘spellchecker’ function. Follow this order when typing manuscripts: Title, Authors, Affiliations, Abstract, Keywords, Main text (including figures and tables), Acknowledgements, and References. Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the paper and do not include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise.

Bulleted lists may be included and should look like this:

- First point
    
- Second point
    
- And so on
    

Tables and Figures

All tables should be numbered with Arabic numerals. Every table should have a caption. Headings should be placed above tables, left justified. Only horizontal lines should be used within a table, to distinguish the column headings from the body of the table, and immediately above and below the table. Tables must be embedded into the text and not supplied separately. Below is an example which the authors may find useful.

  

All figures should be numbered with Arabic numerals (1,2,3,….). Every figure should have a caption. All photographs, schemas, graphs and diagrams are to be referred to as figures. Line drawings should be good quality scans or true electronic output. Low-quality scans are not acceptable. Figures must be embedded into the text and not supplied separately. In MS word input the figures must be properly coded. Preferred format of figures are PNG, JPEG, GIF etc. Lettering and symbols should be clearly defined either in the caption or in a legend provided as part of the figure. Figures should be placed at the top or bottom of a page wherever possible, as close as possible to the first reference to them in the paper. Please ensure that all the figures are of 300 DPI resolutions as this will facilitate good output.The figure number and caption should be typed below the illustration in 8 pt and left justified.

Equations

Equations and formulae should be typed in MathType, and numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals in parentheses on the right hand side of the page (if referred to explicitly in the text). They should also be separated from the surrounding text by one space.

Construction of references

References must be listed at the end of the paper. Do not begin them on a new page unless this is absolutely necessary. Authors should ensure that every reference in the text appears in the list of references and vice versa. Indicate references by [1] or [2] or [3] in the text. Some examples of how your references should be listed are given at the end of this template in the ‘References’ section, which will allow you to assemble your reference list according to the correct format and font size.
