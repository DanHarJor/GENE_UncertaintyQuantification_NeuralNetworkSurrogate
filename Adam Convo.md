nominal growthrate vs expected growthrate. 
If we measure a temperature gradient that is right on the cusp of stability. Then all the growthrates left of the nominal value within the uncertianty would have a 0 growthrate. All the values to the right would have a positive growthrate. This means the expected value of the growthrate would be skewed to the right of the nominal value. So the expected value on the growthrate distribution does not have a one to one map with the nominal value of growthrate. 

Potentially the MAP is still the most likely growthrate.
