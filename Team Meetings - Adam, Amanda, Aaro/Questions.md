Will our framework be ran on the local machine of the user or in a container on the system?

I vote for in the local machine of the user since each HPC system with have different requirements for how to run python. But we can make a yml file to make a local conda enviroment that is a bit more universal. 

Can we please get the entire framework running with simple processes :), reduces framework inconsistencies in the future.
