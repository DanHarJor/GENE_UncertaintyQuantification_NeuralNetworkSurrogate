DIII-D has infrastructure for pulling data in paralell processing. They want people to do stress tests.

There is a paper that says all high dimensional interpolation is actually extrapolation as random points are never in the convex hull. Blanket wrapped around a high D set of points. Might be interesting as people usually say ML is bad at extrapolating.

I should run linear gene to get true distribution for the UQ. 

Adam is doing a similar thing to large scale identification.
