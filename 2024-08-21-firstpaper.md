Today I read William Hornsby's paper. I decided that since he didn't connect to expierment I don't need to for it to be publishable. I will do mode Identification for pedestal plasmas and some stats on what modes are present to what degree compared to eachother. I will compare speeds of surrogate with full GENE. I will do active learning to avoid the stable and high growthrate regions. 

I had a meeting with aaro and amanda about schedule and first paper.

I looked at the idea of going to japan for the school.
