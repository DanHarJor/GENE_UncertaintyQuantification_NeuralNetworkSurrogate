Some pointers for you to consider as you go through the GK and plasma turbulence physics.

The key difference between core turbulence and pedestal turbulence is the ExB shearing in pedestal

This shears the large scale modes (such as ITG) leading to reduced transport

The gradients then grow until smaller scale lenght modes become unstable

these are the modes that we will be simulating

The key difference between what we will do in this work and many of the other GK surrogate modelling work will be this.
