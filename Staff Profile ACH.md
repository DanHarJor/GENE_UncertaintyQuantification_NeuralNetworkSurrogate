project title: GENE Gyrokinetic Uncertainty Quantification with Sparse Grids

There are many aspects of plasma turbulence and transport that remain a mystery. Understanding the motion of the plasma under certain tokamak device scenarios is key to reducing the transport losses that are a major hindrance to fusion performance. The Gyrokinetic vlasov equation is a set differential equation that describes the evolution of charged particle distributions within a magnetic field. GENE uses numerical techniques to solve the Gyrokinetic vlasov equation and can simulate many turbulent and transport phenomena. In order to understand the phenomena within real tokamak devices the turbulence and transport driving plasma properties can be measured and inserted into GENE as an input. These measurements come with experimental errors which limits the accuracy of GENE and the uncertainty needs to be quantified. By treating GENE as a black box and scanning over the uncertainty of the measured quantities it is possible to deduce the uncertainty of GENE's outputs. To reduce the required number of scan points to obtain an accurate uncertainty quantification adaptive sparse grids and interpolation will be implemented. This will ensure the points selected will be the ideal points to train an accurate interpolation algorithm which can then be used to scan over the uncertainty of the measured quantities with much higher resolution with little computation power. The sparse grid approach will also allow a sensitivity analysis which identifies the key experimental parameters that are affecting the turbulence and transport which provides key insights to researchers within the field.
