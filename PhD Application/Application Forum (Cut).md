# Brief summary of the research plan (2000 characters) gm

The plasma wall interaction is a crucial challenge facing the magnetic fusion research community today. Temperatures inside a fusion device are hotter than the core of the sun. The materials of the plasma-facing wall and plasma control systems need to be developed to prevent damage to the plasma-facing wall inside a magnetic fusion device such as a tokamak. The pedestal is a plasma formation at the edge of a tokamak when configured in high confinement mode. Developing fast and accurate physics based simulations for the pedestal is vital for researchers to test their ideas on plasma control systems and plasma-facing wall materials without large investments in device construction. 

GENE is a gyrokinetic code that simulates the positions of plasma particles within an external magnetic field. The plan is to use physics informed machine learning [1] to create a surrogate model of GENE that is tuned to accurately model the pedestal. Similar projects used more traditional machine learning for the core of the plasma [2]. The pedestal is more complex than the core. Generating high-fidelity data for model training is more computationally expensive. The plan includes developing an AI method to generate highly informative or instability-relevant data; allowing an effective model to be created with less data.

A proof of principle version will be created using linear gyrokinetics for a simple magnetic geometry that is cheap to compute. The benefits of physics informed machine learning and informative data creation will be tested against more simple methods.

Introducing the pedestal magnetic geometry and non-linear gyrokinetics will be a major challenge.

The model will be trained to maximum performance with a large database and its usability for various extended research tasks will be tested.

# Motivation for conducting doctoral research (2000 characters) gm 
Describe your motivation for conducting doctoral research in general and for this topic in particular. Also, explain why you have chosen the doctoral programme you are applying to.

My career goal is to use artificial intelligence to accelerate the development of nuclear fusion technologies. Modern data science techniques have not been fully utilised for solving todayâ€™s nuclear fusion issues. The careful application of data science could be the paradigm shift needed to accelerate fusion growth to a point where it is commercially viable. I am excited to contribute to real pioneering research that has the potential to help make fusion a reality. I think a research position suits my personality and preferred work style. I am very self-motivated. I value the ability to follow my curiosity and be creative with my work.

This topic is extremely vital for the realisation of magnetic confinement fusion. I take motivation from the pressing need from society for large amounts of clean and cheap energy. 

The benefits of physics informed machine learning and informative data creation on plasma simulations can also be applied to interstellar plasmas. The 'doctorial program in particle physics and universe sciences' matches the research profile well.

# Rationale for the research project (2000 characters)
How is the project linked to previous research? What are the most significant theoretical and methodological premises of the project?

The project aims to create a surrogate model for GENE (Gyrokinetic Electromagnetic Numerical Experiment). Gyrokinetics strikes an excellent balance between model fidelity and computational cost. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality it takes the 6D kinetic Vlasov equations and reduces them into a set of 5D gyrokinetic Vlasov equations by averaging over the gyration of particles around the magnetic field. It thus keeps track of the particles in the form of charge rings.

Physics-informed machine learning will be used to guide the training of the surrogate model. It is an emerging discipline that has had many successful implementations so far [1 and references therin]. It mainly focuses on incorporating physics derived differential equations into the loss function to be optimised when training model weights. There is also an element of model architecture creation to remove the possibility of physically impossible results and include physical symmetries.

To collect highly informative data for model training Bayesian statistics and information theory will be deployed. The Kulback-Leiber divergence measures how different two distributions are and can be used to measure the information gain of a Bayesian posterior compared to the prior. This can potentially be utilised to identify highly informative data

The uncertainty of the model's predictions can be analysed in the same way as is currently deployed for GENE [3]. This could also aid in model development.  

# Objectives of the research and scientific impact of research results (2000 characters)
What are the **objectives** of the project? Shortly present the **hypotheses** and the research questions. Describe the expected research result and their anticipated novelty value in terms of the research field and the current scientific discussion on the research topic. You may also shortly outline the reach, potential applications and utilization value of the research beyond the scientific community.

The first objective is to create a baseline surrogate model using traditional machine learning methods for a linear gyrokinetic simulation with a simple magnetic geometry (flux tube). The next is to pipeline the use of uncertainty quantification [3] to guide the model development. After, incorporate the physics of gyrokinetics into the training of the model. Tests can be conducted for the hypothesis that physics informed machine learning allows a model to perform well on data outside of the training domain. Another objective is to create an informative data generation system. The hypothesis to test is; can a similar or improved model accuracy can be achieved with less data. Each of these research questions can be reposed when incorporating the physics of the pedestal and its unique magnetic geometry. Although similar research questions have been asked, to the best of my knowledge they have currently never been applied to gyrokinetics or the pedestal. Once trained to max performance, can the surrogate model accurately predict pedestal instabilities in real time for current tokamak control systems.

With the many research questions and fusion technologies that could be developed, deciding which ones to fund or spend time on is an audacious task. Fast simulations allow researchers to quickly select the most promising of ideas and accurate simulations increase the chance of them succeeding. Time and money are limited and this project could save a significant amount of it for the development of fusion technology to serve the people clean and abundant energy.

A model of this region of the plasma would be useful for developing systems for instability mitigation, impurity handling, impurity pellet injection, and wall material synthesis. It would also add to a larger goal of the fusion community of creating a core to edge simulation of the plasma that combines multiple codes for various regions; and an even larger goal of creating a tokamak digital twin.  
# Research methods and materials to be used and its significance for the project (3500 characters) 
Outline the research methods, described so as to explain how they will contribute to answering the research questions/confirming the hypotheses, or how they will support the chosen approach.

For computation power, the project has 500'000 CPU hours and 50'000 GPU hours on the LUMI supercomputer managed by CSC. This is the most powerful supercomputer in Europe. Small nodes will be used for machine learning model development. Larger resources will be requested for initial database generation. Eventually, the entirety of LUMI will be requested for final database creation, training and testing of the max performance model.

The baseline model will be created using standard neural network architectures available on PyTorch and TensorFlow. The uncertainty quantification code has been developed and is openly available [3]. The model structure that minimises the uncertainty can be selected. The physics of Gyrokinetics can inform the model training with various libraries based on PyTorch and TensorFlow, such as DeepXDE, SimNet, PyDEns, NeuroDiff, NeuralPDE and SciANN; as these are based on solving partial differential equations. The method to include the pedestal physics within machine learning is still an open question. SciPy-Stats is a library for probabilistic distributions and statistical operations and can be used to develop the Bayesian highly informative data generator.

The performance of machine learning surrogate models are measured by their ability to produce the same, or similar, results as their parent model when given the same inputs. This can be used to evaluate if the surrogate performs well outside of the training domain and if the informative data creation system can reduce the data required for high performance. There is a project called MGKDB in the USA that aims to build an open Gyrokinetic database for benchmarking various codes and surrogate models. Their framework will be developed alongside the project and will aid in deciding the data format, collection and storage strategies. 
# Preliminary plan on the collection, usage and storage of the research material (1500 characters) 
(except for Doctoral Programme in School, Education, Society and Culture, read the instructions below)

Briefly describe how you plan to collect the research material and use it. Are there any data protection or copyright issues related to data storage that need to be taken into account? Is it possible to make the data available for the use of other researchers?

Reference literature will be stored on an encrypted work laptop hard drive and not made accessible to the public. GENE is open source and data created by GENE can be made open to the public. Any model trained using the GENE data can also be made available to the public. There is reason to believe that real experimental data from JET could be beneficial for training, testing or hyperparameter tuning the model. This would improve the models' accuracy for real life situations. The experimental data from the JET tokamak is governed by EUROfusion. VTT is the representative entity of Finland in the EUROfusion consortium. VTT employees and linked third parties, such as the University of Helsinki, can gain access to EUROfusion data through signing a user agreement. The applicant already has the necessary user account to access the data at JET. Any model trained on the JET data would not be made available to the public but could be made available to those within the EUROfusion consortium.

# Ethical issues (1000 characters) 
Are there ethical issues (e.g. ethical governance procedures, informed consent, and anonymity of subjects) that need to be taken into account when conducting the research? Does conducting the research require a research permit or a permit from the ethical board and/or the Animal Experiment Board? 

There are no ethical issues.

Physics Informed Machine Learning Gyrokinetic Surrogate Model for Pedestal Plasmas within a Tokamak. 
Once the surrogate model has been trained and tested on simulations of plasmas with a pedestal magnetic geometry and fusion-related particle population this is a truly novel contribution.

Pedestal Physics Incorporated into Gyrokinetic Surrogate Model
There is a direct workflow to Include the gyrokinetic differential equations within physics informed machine learning for the first mentioned paper. Including pedestal physics specifically, is still an open question for the project and if solved would deserve a paper on its own. 

Data Reduction via Physics Informed Machine Learning and Bayesian Oracle Active Learning for Gyrokinetic Pedestal Plasma Surrogate Model.
Bayesian oracle active learning is a machine learning technical term for the highly informative data generator. The physics involvement and informative data generator contribute to needing less data for training. This paper quantifies exactly how much less data is required for the same performance. 

High-Performance Gyrokinetic Surrogate Model for Pedestal Plasmas
After everything has been incorporated into the surrogate it will be beyond physics-informed, it will be something new in its own right. After training the surrogate on a large amount of data and testing it on an even larger amount of data the results will hopefully be a spectacle to behold in terms of speed and accuracy for gyro-kinetic simulations.
