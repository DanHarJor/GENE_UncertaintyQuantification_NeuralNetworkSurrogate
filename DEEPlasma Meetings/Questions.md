### David Hatch:  Linear is cheap why surrogate?
When is linear gene too slow and the community would benifit from a surrogate model?? Not sure what we are trying to achieve with a linear surrogate model as linear GENE is already cheap.

ans Aaro: Linear Gene is still a kinetic model, for real time it is too slow. For large solution space scoping it is also too slow. We need answers instantly.

ans Adam: to make it differentiable, linear gene is fast but it is not differentiable. It is nice to have a differentiable function to explore the parameter space and identify places where a non-linear gene run should be made. 

just focus on making a super fast linear GENE for now.

### David Hatch: Standard Quasi Linear Derivation
Is there a good derivation for the quasi-linear heat transfer equation or is dimensional analysis all we got?

### Discussion Point: Qualikiz
By trying to do the standard quasilinear and surrogate it are we not just doing a poorer version of Qualikiz. Maybe Qualikiz is only for core and doesn't go into the pedestool.

### Discussion Point: GENE Pedestal Surrogate before experimental validation,
Seems strange to do a GENE surrogate of the pedestal before people have verified that GENE matches experiment in the pedestal. 

### Open, Answered in MJ course
What physics problems are researches interested in using GENE / Linear GENE, for apart from heat transport? 

Particle transport and turbulance, see last few slides of MJ 

$Q = \frac{P_n + P_\alpha}{P_H}$
