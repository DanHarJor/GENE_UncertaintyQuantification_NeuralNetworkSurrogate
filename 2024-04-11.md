I finished my slided for the meeting today, adding in the interpretation of the growthrate spectrum and the gene inputs and outputs

I went to the finnfusion lunch and seminar where anttii snicker presented about ascots ability to model the fast ions in the edge and how this effects the spluttering of the plasma facing wall.

I attended the tsvv1-10 meeting where they talked about integrated modeling. 

I presented my slides to DEEPlasma group to help them understand GENE and the surrogate model we will make.
