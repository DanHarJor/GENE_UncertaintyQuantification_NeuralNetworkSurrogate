# Highest Absolute Surplus
The grid points that are refined at each step are the ones with the highest absolute surplus. 

In the context of sparse grids, the term “grid point with the highest absolute surplus” refers to the grid point where the hierarchical surplus (or hierarchical coefficient) has the largest absolute value.

The hierarchical surplus is a measure of the difference between the function value at a grid point and the interpolated value from coarser grid levels. It indicates how much a particular grid point contributes to the overall approximation. [A high absolute surplus means that the grid point significantly improves the accuracy of the approximation in its local region](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31703-3_3)[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31703-3_3)[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.0010.pdf).
