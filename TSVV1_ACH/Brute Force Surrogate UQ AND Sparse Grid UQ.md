# Main Idea

Taking a surrogate model that is believed to be 'sufficiently' accurate one can heavily sample the GENE input uncertainty parameter space and generate statistics that can be used to get the output distribution (mean and variance), sensitivity analysis (sobel indicies). 

# Potential Benefits

- Obtain the full distribution of the parameter of interest given the uncertainty
- If a distribution can be sampled it can be used as the input uncertainty distribution

| 20D is pushing the limit of GPR and so its performance needs to be tested. This is because GPR requires an assumption of prior knowledge of the covariance between points in space which can be difficult to define in high dimensions. Could be coupled with a dimension reduction strategy like transformers to exploit inherit lower dimensionality. Or the uncertainty could be quantified for models that are known well for larger dimensions.<br><br>Many inferences will be needed to fill a high D space. The inferences can be extremely fast with only a few matrix multiplications needed. It needs to be tested if this speed is enough to beat the curse of dimensionality. | Sparse Grids were developed with the intention of combating the curse of dimensionality using a smoothness assumption.

In reality the growthrate is negative and if it is significiantly far from 0 then this could negativly affect the quality of the UQ as it tries to represent incorrect values.                                          | Stable - Non Stable Transition.<br><br>GENE does not return negative growthrates for modes that are stable. This limitation of the model needs to be accounted for in the UQ. <br><br>Could GENE be asked to track a specific mode that we know is unstable in another region of the parameter space?? |
| I know that any distribution that can be sampled can be used for the input parameter uncertainty distribution easily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Ionut says this is possible although I am not aware on how easy it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Ability to take any input parameter uncertainty distribution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
