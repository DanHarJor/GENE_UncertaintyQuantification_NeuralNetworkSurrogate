This project is started on the basis that the SSG assumes the functions are smooth and so should not perform well when there are mode transitions. 

Brute force methods have shown that a SSG-poly that 'poorly' fits the ground truth performs similarly well to a GPR-surrogate that 'better' fits the ground truth. The metrics for similar performance are a similar mean, variance, and growthrate uncertainty distribution.

Perhaps we should work to quantify how well the UQ-surrogate must match the ground truth to validate the UQ results.
