the temperature gradient can have an uncertianty of about  20 - 30%

omn and omt are the particle and temperature gradients.

The frequency changing sign is a tell there was a mode transition. One instability begins to dominate over another. 

We are interested in a sharp change in growth rate, also a tell of a mode transition and the issue with the current uncertainty quantification. 

I will use Tobias's scan, to get grothrate uncertainty due to temperature and particle gradient uncertianty.

I will use ionuts sparse grid way to do the same

then I will use s++ spatialy adaptive, to do it again.

You just need to specify the range of values for s++ and it will do the rest.
