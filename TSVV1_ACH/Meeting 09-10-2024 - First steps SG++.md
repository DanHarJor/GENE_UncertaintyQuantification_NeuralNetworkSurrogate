function to try: 16(x0−1)x0(x1−1)x1
Thesis: Spatially Adaptive Sparse Grids for High-Dimensional Problems - check basis functions, modlinbasis or linbasis, check accuracy of surrogate. 
function for suggestion of next points = heiracle volume, good for integration,
volume of the error, good loss function for
